This is the self-narrated story of Matthew McConaughey, the person, not the actor. The life of this man and the story of the book is guided by a marked principle; the concern with getting too comfortable and taking the challenge as the only way possible to move forward. Matthew considers that the _McConaissance_ is for everyone who finds out that the call to self-knowledge through adventure is not an option but a moral imperative. Imprinted with his iconic charisma, the audio narration is a highly entertaining story of how Matthew developed his own character.
