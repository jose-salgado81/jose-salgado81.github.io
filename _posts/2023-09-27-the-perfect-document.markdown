# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for High-Quality Documentation

In [*Technical Writing: How to Write Software Documentation*](https://www.udemy.com/course/start-your-career-as-user-assistance-developer/), Jordan Stanchev shares the outcomes of his research in defining high-quality software documentation. By establishing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), it becomes possible to precisely gauge the direction of improvement.

This is much appreciated information.

Quality in Documentation KPIs:
| **KPI**                              | **Attributes**                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Helpful**                          | solves problems, illustrates use cases (user journeys), remains relevant                               |
| **Comprehensive**                    | uses consistent terminology, covers end-to-end processes, aligns with industry standards               |
| **Searchable**                       | easy to find, easy search and navigation, SEO optimized                                                |
| **Visual**                           | includes a lot of images, incorporates short videos, uses diagrams wherever possible                   |
| **Usable**                           | short and to the point, well-organized by typical usage, provides answers with minimal effort          |
| **Readable**                         | clear and easy to understand, well-structured content, suitable for the target audience                |
| **Reliable**                         | information is from reliable sources and has been validated, up-to-date, accurate                      |
| **Grammatically correct**            | easy to understand, no grammar errors, no spelling mistakes, meaningful language                       |
| **Translatable and easy location**   | easy to translate to other languages, easy to localize                                                 |
| **Accessible**                       | deployable by print or online, can be shared, logical location, accessible at the point of need        |
| **Uses appropriate tone**            | direct, simple, adheres to guidelines and rules for writing                                            |


However, it's crucial to note that these scores should stem from User Research and Analysis, not personal assessment.
