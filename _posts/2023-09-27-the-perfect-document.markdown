# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for High-Quality Documentation

In [*Technical Writing: How to Write Software Documentation*](https://www.udemy.com/course/start-your-career-as-user-assistance-developer/), Jordan Stanchev shares the outcomes of his research in defining high-quality software documentation. By establishing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), it becomes possible to precisely gauge the direction of improvement.

This is much appreciated information.

Quality in Documentation KPIs:
- Helpful
- Comprehensive
- Searchable
- Visual
- Usable
- Readable
- Reliable
- Grammatically correct
- Translatable and localization friendly
- Accessible
- Uses appropriate tone

**The scores for these KPIs should stem from User Research and Analysis, not the author's opinion.*

Best regards.
