# Snagit Is The Image Editor For Technical Writers

I often have to do some small image edits here and there that are not expected to be graphic-design level. And while it's tempting to to use things like Paint, the limited functionality eventually gets you. On the other hand, Photoshop or Gimp seem overkill for the job. And that's when I launch Snagit. If you are a technical writer you should get the program anyway just for its screen capture value, but soon you will see how brilliant it is for editing images.

Also, the program is an example of good coding practices; while it's hihghly creative it's never chaotic. Finally, the value of Snagit is excellent. You get a license in perpetuity for about 50 bucks, but I must say that the people at Technsith introduce so many features each year that you should consider getting the maintenance pack to get automatic upgrades to the next versions.
