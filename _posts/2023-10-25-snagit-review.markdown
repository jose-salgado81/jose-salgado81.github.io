# Snagit Is The Image Editor For Technical Writers

I often have to make some small image edits here and there that aren't expected to be at a graphic design level. And while it's tempting to use things like Paint, their limited functionality quickly shows. On the other hand, programs like Photoshop or Gimp seem like overkill. 

That's when I launch Snagit. 

If you are a technical writer, you should get the program anyway just for its screen capture value, and if you do, soon you will see how brilliant it is as a general-purpose image editor.

Also, the program is an example of good coding practices; while it's highly creative, it's never chaotic. And at $50 for a perpetual license, Snagit is a good thing to buy. Try Snagit 2024 for free at [techsmith.com/screen-capture](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html)
