<p><em>He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle.</em></p>

<p>-Quote from an ambiguous origin, often used to describe Churchill’s ability with words</p>

<p>“Darkest Hour” illustrates the relentless sequence of events happening in May and June 1940, nearly leaving Europe under Nazi control.</p>

<p>Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium fell within weeks. The Allies fled continental Europe through Dunkirk, leaving France ready to surrender. German military superiority was unquestionable.</p>

<p>With an ambivalent parliament, a dubious king, and a hesitant America, Churchill only had his words, and his words he used. In his speech, “We Shall Fight on the Beaches,” delivered to the House of Commons on June 4, 1940, Churchill articulated the attitude that the Allies needed to resolve. Churchill, one of the most flamboyant characters in history, is exquisitely interpreted by Gary Oldman, a performance that earned him an Academy Award.</p>
