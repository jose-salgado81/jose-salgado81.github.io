<meta name="description" content="This is the self-narrated story of Matthew McConaughey, the person, not the actor. The life of this man and the story of the book is guided by a marked principle; the concern with getting too comfortable and taking the challenge as the only way possible to move forward. Matthew considers that the McConaissance is for everyone who finds out that the call to self-knowledge through adventure is not an option but a moral imperative. Imprinted with his iconic charisma, the audio narration is a highly entertaining story of how Matthew developed his own character." />
